# Calculator-with-React
React JS Practice 
A simple and functional calculator built with React using the useState hook to manage input and operations. It supports basic arithmetic calculations, a clean UI, and reactive state handling with no direct DOM manipulation. All inputs are managed through button clicks, and the result is evaluated dynamically.

Built for clarity, speed, and clean React principles.
